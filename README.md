# Nugget OS
This is my first real push into OS development, an area I have had profound interest in since high school.

This project is more or less a personal walkthrough or journey (a less kind term would be knock-off) of the series
of [blog posts](https://os.phil-opp.com) by Phil Oppermann on Rust OSDev.

I initially wanted to write a microkernel in C based on the great resources on the [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page).
As it turned out, CMake and all the trappings of a 70s programming language make cross-compilation and testing
far more of a pain than it needs to be. Therefore, switching to Rust and using its ecosystem as a crutch seemed
the more sensible option. 

### License
This project is really stupid. Nobody should seriously use it. I don't even know why you would bother; this is for
me to break hardware over!
